# Movie-Recommender-System

This project was created as an assignment for my university course on Knowledge Discovery from Databases.
The goal of this project is the implementation and evaluation of a collaborative item-item
recommender system for movies based on the use of the Pearson coefficient as its similarity
measure.

When you run the "recommender_system.py" script for a "k", a new row will be added to one of the following CSV files: "weighted_average.csv", "adj.csv", "variance.csv", and "common_users.csv". Each CSV file contains different results from different predictive functions.

When you execute the "display_results.py" script, you will be able to view charts for the CSV files.
